- Create an database based on the previous relational schema;
- Implement an graphic interface capable of interact with the database created. 

Our graphic interface can do simple transactions of an normal store like purchase a product or return a product but is capable of harder operations, for example, list all
the store's workers and check all the sells done by worker.
