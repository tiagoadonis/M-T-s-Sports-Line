# M&T's Sports Line

*__M&T's Sports Line__* is a fictitious brand created just for the final work of databases subject.

This final work had the followings objectives:

- Write the initial requirement analysis;
- Create the respective entityâ€“relationship model;
- Do the relational schema;
- Create an database based on the previous relational schema;
- Implement an graphic interface in VB.NET, capable of interact with the database created. 

The graphic interface has four main categories, stores, clients, workers and deliveries. Each one of this is a tab in our graphic interface where the user 
can check details and procede some operations. Operations like a simple purchase or a return but is also capable of more complex ones, for example, list all
the store's workers and check all the sells done by worker.

Here is some screenshots of the interface:
